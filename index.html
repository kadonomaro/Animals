				<h3>What about cats?<h3>
				<p>
					The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus)is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. 
					They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. 
					They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. 
					There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.	
					Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws and teeth adapted to killing small prey.
					Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. 
					Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. 
					They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. 
					Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.

				<h3>And what about dogs?<h3>
					<p>
						The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species)
						is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
						The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,
						which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, 
						sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species.
						New research seems to show that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic regions in humans where changes are known to trigger high sociability and somewhat reduced intelligence. 
						Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic roles.
						This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".
